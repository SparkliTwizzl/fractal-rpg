 <h1 align="center">Overview</h1>
 
Fractal RPG is a work in progress system themed around time travel. Currently, you play as a time police agent working to preserve the integrity of history. The party is given a historic event that they must make sure happens more or less how historic accounts recorded it. The specific details of how they achieve this is up to them.

<h1 align="center">Versions</h1>

Versions are divided into editions, which are subdivided into revisions, then updates, then fixes.<br/>
Edition is incremented when the core rules are changed.<br/>
Revision is incremented when features are added or removed or rules are changed.<br/>
Update is incremented for minor changes, such as a rule clarification or a terminology change.<br/>
Fix is incremented when problems are fixed, such as a digital materials bug or a rule loophole.

See below for an explanation of the version numbering and naming schemes.

<h3 align="center">Version number / nickname schemes</h3>

<h4>Version numbers</h4>

LONG: Nth Edition, Nth Revision, Nth Update, Nth Fix<br/>
SHORT: Edition.Revision.Update.Fix

Revision can be omitted if revision, update, and fix are 0.<br/>
Update can be omitted if update and fix are 0.<br/>
Fix can be omitted if it is 0.

<h4>Version nicknames</h4>

Edition Nickname | Adjective Adjective Noun (Fix Update Revision)

Edition nicknames are independent of revision nicknames, and can be omitted, as all revision nicknames are unique.

Revision nicknames follow a pattern, with the revision noun staying consistent across all updates and fixes to that revision (ie, all updates and fixes to a revision called "Cowboy" would retain the word "Cowboy" in their nicknames).

The update adjective is changed when an update to a version is published (ie, an update to "Loud Cowboy" might be called "Chaotic Cowboy").

For simplicity, no fix adjective is given when the fix is 0. If a fix is published for a version, the fix adjective is  changed (ie, a fix to "Loud Cowboy" might be called "Very Loud Cowboy", and an additional fix might be called "Slightly Loud Cowboy").

<h4>In-progress version numbers</h4>

v~W.X.Y.Z<br/>
In-progress version numbers are prefixed with a tilde and are subject to change.

<h4>Unfinished release version numbers</h4>

Edition.{Revision.{Update}}~YYMMDD

Unfinished versions of fixes are not published, since the changes are so minor.<br/>
The zero part of the version number (ie, X.Y.Z.{0}, X.Y.{0.0}, X.{0.0.0}) is replaced by a tilde followed by the date of the unfinished release in ISO 1806:2000 basic truncated format, ie: The 2-digit year, the 2-digit month, and the 2-digit day, with no spaces.

<h4>Unfinished release version nicknames</h4>

Edition{ Revision{ Update}} unfinished YYYY-MM-DD

Unfinished version are not given nicknames. Instead, the nickname is simply "unfinished", followed by the date of the unfinished release in ISO 1806 extended format, ie: The 4-digit year, a dash, the 2-digit month, a dash, and the 2-digit day, with no spaces.

EXAMPLES:

- An unfinished version of 3rd Edition, 0th Revision, 0th Update released on Aug 17th, 2015 would be called "v3.~150817 (3rd Edition unfinished 2015-08-17)"
- An unfinished version of 9th Edition, 4th Revision, 0th Update released on Feb 24th, 2028 would be called "v9.4.~280224 (9th Edition 4th Revision unfinished 2028-02-24)"
- An unfinished version of 5th Edition, 0th Revision, 1st Update released on Jan 1st, 2000 would be called "v5.0.1.~000101 (5th Edition 0th Revision 1st Update unfinished 2000-01-01)"
